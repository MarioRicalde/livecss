This plugin underlays the hexadecimal, rgb or named CSS color codes with their real color.
The foreground color is selected oppositely.

#Documentation
I tried to make code as readable as I can and I will keep on improving documentation quality.
Nice html documentation is available [here][1]

#Featuers:
- Live on-the-fly colorization
- Or using ST commands
- Less/SCSS/CSS support
- Local/global settings

#Plans:
- Colorizing only selected regions
- Write better code documentation
- Better background selection based on current theme's background
- Improve code quality

#Limitations:
1. Still in beta, may contains bugs.
2. It assumes all theme are in `Packages/Color Scheme - Default folder` folder
